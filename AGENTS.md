# AGENTS.md — coding-agent guide for lobby-display

Rules live here; every `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import. Edit this file, never the
import. A rule that applies to one folder goes in a nested `AGENTS.md` there, with its own
one-line `CLAUDE.md` beside it.

## What this repo is

The lobby screen for the residential building at Yesod HaMaala 9, Hod HaSharon: a React + Vite single-page app that runs 24/7 on a kiosk display device (Fully Kiosk Browser on Android TV / MX boxes), with a built-in admin panel at `/#admin` for the building's managers and a draft preview at `/#preview`. It is deployed on Vercel, with serverless functions under `api/` and shared screen state in Supabase. UI text, code comments and the in-app changelog are in Hebrew. What a newcomer gets wrong: the display devices run an old Chrome (61-era) browser, so the Vite build targets `es2015` / `chrome61` / `safari11` — modern browser APIs need checking against that target, not against a current desktop browser.

## Layout

| Package / folder | Role | Depends on |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| `src/App.jsx`, `src/main.jsx` | The display screen: top status bar, main slide rotation, events rail, notices, tickers, full-screen Shabbat / Yom Tov / urgent modes | `src/lib/`, `react`, `react-dom` |
| `src/admin/` | The PIN-gated admin panel (`/#admin`): settings, banners, notices, ticker, playlist, holidays, device install card | `src/lib/`, `/api/state` |
| `src/lib/` | Shared logic: draft/publish store and one-time migrations (`store.js`), Hebrew calendar and holiday banners (`hebrew.js`), SVG artwork, themes, media in IndexedDB, feeds, server time, auto-update | `@hebcal/core`, `/api/*` |
| `src/version.js` | Single source of truth for `VERSION` and the in-app `CHANGELOG` | — |
| `api/` | Vercel serverless functions (Node): `state`, `weather`, `ynet`, `news`, `aluma-events`, `time` | Supabase REST, Open-Meteo, ynet RSS, alumahod.com |
| `public/` | Static assets served as-is | — |

_[FILL IN: the boundary rule between them — what may import what, and where a cross-cutting helper goes.]_

## Public contracts

- The HTTP endpoints under `api/`: `GET`/`POST /api/state` (PIN-authenticated write of the shared screen state, Supabase table `lobby_state`, row `yesod9`; with no PIN stored every write is refused unless it carries the `LOBBY_ADMIN_PIN` env secret, which then becomes the stored PIN), `GET /api/weather`, `GET /api/ynet`, `GET /api/news`, `GET /api/aluma-events`, `GET /api/time` — the display devices in the field call these on every refresh.
- The hash routes `/`, `/#admin`, `/#preview` — the kiosk device's Start URL points at the display route.
- The browser storage the field devices already hold: `localStorage` keys `lobby_*` / `lobby_draft_*` and the IndexedDB database `lobby-media`. A shape change needs a `migrateOnce` migration in `src/lib/store.js`, because deployed screens are not touched by hand.
- The Vercel config in `vercel.json` (SPA rewrite that spares `api/`, `no-store` on `/` and `/index.html`, which the auto-update check in `src/lib/autoUpdate.js` relies on).

Changing any of them is a behavior change, never a refactor. Before changing a shared module, grep its consumers across the repo; a signature change enumerates every call site.

| [docs/guides/](docs/guides/) | Guides, indexed by [docs/guides/README.md](docs/guides/README.md). |

Docs mirror rules and code for humans. When a change makes a guide, design doc, or README wrong, update it in the same change. Don't load a doc to follow a rule.

## Common tasks

| Command | Effect |
| ------- | ------ |
| `npm ci` | Install dependencies from `package-lock.json` |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/` (the command Vercel runs) |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the built `dist/` locally |
| `npm run lint` | Lint with oxlint (`.oxlintrc.json`) |
| `npm test` | Run the tests (`node --test`; `*.test.js`, kept off Vercel by `.vercelignore`) |
| `npm run lint && npm run build` | The aggregate check (lint, then build) |

`npm run lint && npm run build` is the aggregate check. _[FILL IN: turn it into one `npm run check` script; say which checks it skips — the browser run on the kiosk device, the `api/` functions against live Supabase — and when to run those by hand.]_

## Git

- Never include the Claude Code session link (`Claude-Session:` trailer, `https://claude.ai/code/session_...`) in commit messages, PR bodies, or issue and review comments.
- The `Co-Authored-By` trailer names `Agent`, never the full model/email.
- A PR body ends with `Co-Authored-By: Agent`, never with a "Generated with Claude Code" line or any other tool attribution.

### Git Commit Conventions

Commits follow Conventional Commits

```
type(scope): short description
```

| Type       | When to use                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or capability                 |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                   |
| `refactor` | Code change with no functional difference |
| `test`     | Adding or fixing tests                    |
| `chore`    | Maintenance, dependency updates, tooling  |

Scope identifies the affected package(s) or area.
Scope is optional for changes that span the whole repo or don't map cleanly to a single package.

**Rules**

- Description is lowercase, no trailing period.
- Use imperative mood: "add", "fix", "remove" — not "added" or "fixes".
- If a commit spans more than 2 scopes, omit the scope, keep only the type, and use a multi-line commit for details.

**Multi-line commits**

Prefer multi-line format whenever a commit includes multiple distinct changes — not just for PR squash merges. Use a single-line message only when the commit does exactly one thing.

Add a body listing the individual changes as bullet points. Omit iterative `type(scope)` bullets that only refine or clean up work introduced earlier in the same PR — include only bullets that add distinct value.

**Bullet prefix rule:** if every bullet has the same `type(scope)` as the subject line, omit `type(scope):` from all bullets and write only the description. If any bullet differs, include `type(scope):` on all bullets.

### Git Branch Rules

- **Protected branches: `main` — commits land there only via PRs or automated tooling, never manually.** Always work on a feature branch and open a PR.
- Branch naming: `feat/<description>`, `fix/<issue-number>-<description>`, `refactor/<issue-number>-<description>`.

### Issues

Issues carry the label of their kind: `bug` for a defect or regression, `enhancement` for a feature or behavior change, and _[FILL IN: the label for cleanup with no behavior change — the repo has no `refactor` label]_. Title: one specific line naming the area and the symptom, capability, or target.

### Pull Requests

- Label the PR to match the issue it closes, adding `security`, `breaking`, etc. when they apply.
- The PR body closes its issue (`Closes #<n>`).

## House rules

### Workflow rules

- **When the user asks a question, discuss first** — don't jump to implementation or edits as a response.
- **Be direct and concise** — no pleasantries, no preamble, no filler. Disclaimers and caveats stay short; the response goes to the main answer. Asked to explain something, give the high-level summary unless depth is asked for.
- **Link what you name.** A file or a doc section in a reply is a markdown link ([AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [Git](AGENTS.md#git)), never a bare path.
- **Report an edit, don't paste it.** What changed, where (linked), and why — the user reads the file.
- **Feedback in chunks.** Review findings or suggestions you volunteer in an interactive conversation come in chunks of up to five points, saying how many remain. A skill's prescribed report is presented as that skill says, and an unattended run sends the whole report in one message.
- **Ask before adding a dependency.** Prefer what the repo already has.
- **Ask before generating `.md` docs**, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- **A document is as long as its task needs.** Cover the substance; no filler sections, restated summaries, or boilerplate. A skill's or template's required sections are substance — the rule governs what fills them and what is added beyond them.
- **Search the web for current docs when researching a dependency, API, or tool** — training data is stale. Verify against the installed version before applying advice.
- **If a rule conflicts with a task, ask** — don't silently bypass.
- **TDD is mandatory for features, fixes, and behavior changes** — the `tdd` skill: a failing test first, then the minimum to pass.
- **`npm run lint && npm run build` must pass before committing.** Before reporting a PR ready, run it again plus whichever manual checks Common tasks names.

### Technical rules

- **Design principles: DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID — in that order of frequency.** Don't abstract until the second duplicate. Don't add config knobs, hooks, or generics for a use case that isn't in the diff. An established codebase pattern is not over-engineering: repeating it for new code is expected; flag as YAGNI only abstractions nothing in the codebase uses.
- **Tests live next to source as `*.test.js` / `*.test.jsx`.** Every new public function, type, or component ships with tests in the same commit; cover the happy path, the documented edge cases (empty, null, error), and failure paths. Tests exercise real logic.
- **Document non-obvious logic only.** A short comment explaining _why_ (invariant, workaround, protocol quirk, ADR reference) is welcome. Don't restate _what_ the code does.
- **Never count what the text lists.** "The three options", "both callbacks", "these five steps" — in a doc, a comment, a docstring, or a commit body — go stale the moment an item is added or removed. Let the list carry its length.
- **When a code question is really an architecture question, read the ADR before editing.** A boundary or a shape that looks wrong was decided, not overlooked.
- **Follow existing code patterns.** Different areas may differ in style — adapt. When existing code and these rules disagree, the rules win: legacy code may predate them.
- **Every significant change bumps `VERSION` (semver) and adds an entry at the top of `CHANGELOG` in [src/version.js](src/version.js)** — it is the single source of truth for the version the screen shows, and the README title carries the same version.
- **Never add `export const config` with a `runtime` to a function in `api/`** — Vercel detects Node on its own.
- **Code for the display must run on the build target in [vite.config.js](vite.config.js)** (`es2015`, `chrome61`, `safari11`): old Android TV / MX boxes run the screen. The display runs unattended 24/7, so network and feed failures fall back silently to cached data rather than surfacing an error.

### Checks and evidence

Each of these exists because its absence ships something wrong.

- **Every claim in a report is audited against a tool result from this session.** Report only work you can point to evidence for, and say explicitly what is not yet verified. Outcomes faithfully: a failing test with its output, a skipped step named, and what is done and verified stated plainly, without hedging.
- Every guard, gate, or check must be provably able to fail: break what it guards, watch it go red, revert. A check you cannot demonstrate red is not a check.
- Catches fail closed. A tool error, an empty result, or a skipped step never reads as "no findings".
- Numbers in commit messages and PR bodies are prose; evidence is the command that ran and its exit status.

## Security

When writing or reviewing code, check for the following. The categories follow the OWASP Top 10; look an item up there for depth. Severity: **HIGH** = blocker,
**MEDIUM** = should fix, **LOW** = consider fixing but always notify the team.

### HIGH — Blockers

- **Hardcoded credentials or API keys** (Security Misconfiguration) in source code or committed config files.
- **Sensitive data exposure** (Cryptographic Failures): secrets, tokens, or PII written to logs, included in error output, or returned beyond what the caller needs.
- **Untrusted input reaching a shell, a query, a parser, or a filesystem path unvalidated** (Injection) — injection and path traversal. Parameterize queries; sanitize any path built from input.
- **Authorization bypass** (Broken Access Control): a route, handler, or gateway without the guard its data requires; misconfigured scopes or access options.
- **IDOR** (Insecure Direct Object Reference; Broken Access Control): resource access without verifying that the resource belongs to the authenticated principal or that they hold the right to it.
- **Missing input validation** (Injection) at the boundary — no schema or DTO validation on an endpoint that accepts caller-controlled data.
- **Insecure design** (Insecure Design): a feature with no auth boundary, data reachable without any ownership check, or no way to restrict access after the fact — caught at design time, before implementation.

### MEDIUM — Should fix

- **Cryptographic failures** (Cryptographic Failures): weak algorithms, hardcoded IVs, home-rolled crypto, insufficient key lengths; secrets encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Unhandled errors** (Security Misconfiguration) — an uncaught rejection, panic, or exception that leaks a stack trace or internal state to a caller.
- **SSRF** (Server-Side Request Forgery): a caller-controlled URL used in a server-side request without allowlisting or validation.
- **Integrity of external payloads** (Software and Data Integrity Failures): webhook callbacks, OAuth or SSO launches, and third-party responses are verified (signature, HMAC, JWT validation) before trust; internal queue messages are inside the trusted boundary.
- **Overly permissive CORS** (Security Misconfiguration): origins validated against known hosts.
- **Missing rate limiting** (Identification and Authentication Failures) on authentication, token issuance, or other sensitive endpoints.
- **Security misconfiguration** (Security Misconfiguration): debug or admin endpoints left enabled, permissive error responses, unnecessary modules enabled, default credentials.
- **Security logging gaps** (Security Logging and Monitoring Failures): failed auth attempts, permission denials, and sensitive data access leave no record.

### LOW — Consider

- **Vulnerable or outdated components** (Vulnerable and Outdated Components): when adding or upgrading a dependency, verify it has no known CVEs and is actively maintained.
- **Verbose error messages** (Security Misconfiguration) that reveal implementation structure to clients.
- **Missing audit logging** (Security Logging and Monitoring Failures) on sensitive operations — who did what, and when.
- **Long-lived tokens** (Identification and Authentication Failures) without expiry or rotation.

**Audit trail (required at design time).** Any state-changing endpoint on a sensitive entity — permission changes, content moderation, data deletion, anything financial or graded — specifies, before implementation: which identity is captured (the authenticated user, the API key, or a system identifier), which field or log entry carries it, and where it is extracted from. A state-changing endpoint without identity capture is a compliance and incident-response gap.

## Code conventions

### General

- No magic numbers or strings — named constants.
- No commented-out code. A `TODO` / `FIXME` references a ticket or states a clear action.
- No debug prints in shipped code — use the project's logger.
- Prefer early return over nested conditionals; split a function with many branches.
- When a function takes more than two parameters, two of the same type, or any boolean, take one named argument object (or struct) instead.
- Lint and typecheck every file you touch before finishing; lint errors are often real bugs — a missing await, an unhandled error, a wrong import.

### JavaScript (React, JSX)

_[FILL IN: naming, typing, and idiom rules for JavaScript (React, JSX) that a linter does not already enforce]_

## Permissions when running unattended

This section applies when you run as a subagent, in a background task, or in a non-interactive session — anywhere a permission prompt has no one to answer it. An interactive session simply asks; a denied call there means the user declined, so adjust the approach rather than retry it.

Unattended, a denied tool call is a silent failure mid-workflow. A call must pass both the tools the session has and the project's permission lists (`.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code — `permissions.allow` is auto-approved, `permissions.deny` is blocked). Read them at the start and plan around them.

- Each piped variant of a shell command needs its own allow entry: `Bash(git log*)` does not cover `git log | head`.
- Fetch only allowed domains; call only allowed MCP tools; check the deny list for path restrictions before editing.
- When a needed tool is missing, try a permitted alternative; if none exists, stop and report — do not retry the denied call.
- At the end of your work, list any tool you needed but could not use, so the user can extend the settings:

```
MISSING PERMISSIONS:
  - <Tool>(<pattern>): <why needed>
```
